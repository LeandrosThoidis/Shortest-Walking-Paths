# SWaP – Shortest Walking Paths

**SWaP** is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and published in **EDULEARN24**. It provides optimized walking directions across university campuses using efficient routing algorithms such as **Dijkstra’s**, **A\***, and their **bidirectional variants**.

Once added to the user’s home screen, **SWaP** launches in full-screen mode and works **offline**, acting as a smart e-assistant for campus navigation.
